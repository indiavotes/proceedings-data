"""Shared text-sharding helper for the parliamentwatch corpora.

Bundles per-record text files (`docs/<corpus>/text/<name>.txt`) into
size-targeted shard files (`docs/<corpus>/texts-NN.json`) plus a
manifest (`docs/<corpus>/texts-meta.json`). Reduces the static-assets
file count by 50-200x per corpus while keeping each shard well under
Cloudflare's 25 MiB per-file cap.

See `plan/cloudflare-strategy-002.md` for the design rationale (bundling
primary, R2 fallback for oversize records).

Each corpus's build script generates the input list
`[(composite_id, Path), ...]` in its own canonical sort order
(newest-first by convention) and passes it here. This module doesn't
know per-corpus naming or sort logic — it just packs greedily.

R2 fallback: any single record whose text exceeds `fallback_threshold`
gets a `{"r2": true}` sentinel in the shard. App fetches that record's
body from the R2 origin (already populated by the .github/workflows/
r2-sync.yml workflow). Threshold defaults to 1 MB — at the target 4.5 MB
shard size, allowing larger inline texts means one big record could
dominate a shard, defeating the cache-locality win.

#   - compute_audit reads markers.json (instead of scanning the dir)
#   - extract candidate selection reads markers.json (to skip
